# RAG System for Leave No Context Behind Paper

## Overview
This project aims to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the LangChain framework. The system will leverage the capabilities of the Gemini 1.5 Pro language model to answer questions related to the "Leave No Context Behind" paper published by Google on 10th April 2024. The LangChain framework will facilitate the retrieval of external data, such as the mentioned paper, and pass it to the Gemini model during the generation step.

## Components
1. **LangChain Framework**: LangChain is a Python library that enables seamless integration between language models and external data sources. It provides functionalities to retrieve, preprocess, and feed external data to language models during inference.

2. **Gemini 1.5 Pro Model**: Gemini 1.5 Pro is a large language model developed by OpenAI, known for its advanced natural language processing capabilities. It will serve as the core model for generating answers to questions related to the "Leave No Context Behind" paper.

3. **"Leave No Context Behind" Paper**: The paper published by Google on 10th April 2024 serves as the primary external data source. It contains valuable information and insights relevant to the questions that the RAG system will address.

## Workflow
1. **Data Retrieval**: The LangChain framework will retrieve the "Leave No Context Behind" paper from its source, which could be in PDF or text format.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The retrieved paper will undergo preprocessing to extract relevant sections or passages that contain information pertinent to the questions.

3. **Question Answering**: When a question is posed to the RAG system, LangChain will pass both the question and the preprocessed data from the paper to the Gemini 1.5 Pro model. Gemini will then generate an answer based on its understanding of the input question and the context provided by the paper.

4. **Answer Presentation**: The generated answer will be presented to the user, providing valuable insights and information extracted from the "Leave No Context Behind" paper.

## Implementation
The project will be implemented using Python 3.9 with dependencies on LangChain framework and the Gemini 1.5 Pro model. The codebase will be organized into modular components to facilitate maintenance and scalability.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional external data sources to enrich the RAG system's knowledge base.
- Fine-tuning the Gemini model on domain-specific data to improve its performance on questions related to research papers.
- Implementation of a user interface for seamless interaction with the RAG system.

## Conclusion
By leveraging the LangChain framework and the Gemini 1.5 Pro model, this project aims to develop an advanced RAG system capable of answering questions related to the "Leave No Context Behind" paper with high accuracy and contextual understanding. The system will serve as a valuable tool for researchers, students, and anyone seeking insights from the latest research publications.
